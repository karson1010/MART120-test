	<br /><br />
	Week 3 was the week we worked on using Scracth for our own projects! I definitely felt sparks fly during this week!
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Scratch is a user interface that allows users to make stroies or games with characters and bakcgrounds.
	<br />
	It ustilizes variables, timing and mouse interation to have your story/game work. I used Scracth to create a stroy about a rock band, i utilized the sound features and character timing to give a great performance!
	<br />

	here is the link to my story, it's a rocking time!
