Learning Styles
I believe learning styles are important to students in the way that they will find what suits them best for how they study. If a student is shown a certain way to study and is pushed on that way, the way they are taught may or may not work for them. This could be a 50/50 shot of coming out successful. I feel it is important to let students find what works for them instead of having ways already set out. Even if students find they like the ways already set, then let them enjoy it but everyone needs their own way eventually. 
Students in this generation are becoming more and more accommodated for what they need to help them excel in school. Every student is different and if students are being tested on how well they do with their study habits, not every result is going to be a good outcome. Some students get test anxiety and can often have mistakes on their work when doing a test or some students need accommodations that they just don’t know about yet. It’s hard to narrow down what actually helps students excel and what won’t. But I feel if students are allowed to study and gain knowledge as they please, there should be no issue in what type of study style they choose. As long as it is helping them grow and not letting them slack.
